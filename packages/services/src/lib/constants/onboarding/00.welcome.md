## 📖 Notebooks for the Internet

---

Mist is a tool for exploring and creating your personal interests alongside the internet. It enables you to do two things:

- **Collect and organize your favorite bits of the internet** — PDFs, YouTube videos, documents, images, and much more — into private and personal “notebooks”.

- **Generate editable Notion-style documents** (with AI or manually) from the bits of the internet that are relevant to you, with links pointing back directly to your context.

### 💎 How Mist Is Different

---

Mist _is not_ just another browser or chat app. We believe current AI Browsers combine the worst of both worlds. They add a chat onto a browser to automate human consumption.

Mist is designed from the ground-up for **exploration** and **creation**. It’s not primarily about consuming what others have created, but about helping you create something new.

### 📚 Notebooks: Mist’s Approach to Data

---

Data from across the web (PDFs, YouTube, documents, images, & more) and your own notes can be collected and organized together in one place: a notebook. Anything you add into a notebook is stored on your local machine, creating a local file, database entry, and embedding (for the AI).

This local data can be used to generate new notes, either in combination with other pieces of data, or by it's own. The stored data is private and personal to you, and is never shared with anyone else (but do keep in mind, that the embeddings are read by the AI model of your choice).

### 📝 Notes: Creating with Mist

---

Mist notes are rich text documents that are generated or manually created from your personal media. They are similar to Notion pages, but come with some unique features:

- **Context-aware:** Mist notes are aware of the media in your notebook, and can pull-in relevant information and suggestions from your saved stuff. You can `@` mention specific sources in your prompts to fine-tune the context and get more accurate and relevant results.
- **Citations:** when Mist's AI uses your saved media (or sources from the internet), it generates citations that will take you to exact sections of PDFs, timestamps in YouTube videos, portions of websites and so on.
- **Tools:**
  - **Web search** is used to automatically search the web, and brings back summaries of the findings based on the user prompt
  - **Mistlets (app generation)** are coded mini-apps that help you understand what you find on the internet, whether it's a table or a graph or a physics concept.

The Mist Notes editor supports the Markdown Syntax so you can add headings, lists and _style the text_. You can also type `/` to bring up the command menu to add elements.

Type `@` to mention any media saved in your notebook or tab you have open in Mist. Then ask Mist's AI to help you write, summarize, or brainstorm based on that context.

💡 Try typing "<i>Create a interactive visualization of our solar system?</i>" into the input box at the bottom and hit enter.
